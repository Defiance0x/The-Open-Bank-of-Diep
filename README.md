The .xlsx file is to show how the Excel file would be set up and a possible way of filling out the scores.

Scoring Code.py was an extracurricular project I set myself. I used Python to help organise raw scores from archery competitions, hosted by University of Bristol Archery, such that the results section of the event could be run smoothly, and more importantly, quickly due to the usual hour wait from other competitions in the area. The first use of this code had results ready within 10 minutes.

OutdoorScores.xlsx is the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet used to input data for Scoring Code.py to crunch into sorted individual and team archer tables.

N_Body_Simulation was for my high-performance computing module in my 4th year at university. It uses MPI4PY as the parallelisation tool and runs on Python.
